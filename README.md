# Cal-Poly-Pomona-Transit-Data-Base-System
Designed and implemented a database system in MySQL to model a university transit system, including routes, stops, buses, and schedules. Built normalized relational schemas, defined primary/foreign keys, and wrote SQL queries to manage operations such as route assignments, schedule updates, and capacity tracking. Currently extending the project by connecting the database system to Python for advanced querying, automation, and integration with data analysis workflows.

Technologies used:
– MySQL / SQL: Designed and implemented relational schema, queries, and transactions
– Python (in progress): Building integration for database connectivity, querying, and analysis

Conclusions:
This project demonstrates practical database design and the ability to extend relational systems into Python applications for data-driven decision making and future scalability.
